"""Diff two VI versions into a body (``text`` | ``json`` | ``html``).

The shared core behind ``lvkit diff`` AND the MCP ``diff`` tool — both are thin
callers of this; the load+project logic lives here, never duplicated in a
surface. It ORCHESTRATES two layers: the diff ENGINE (``graph.diff`` — the
change set over two graphs, render-agnostic) and, for ``html``, the RENDERER
(``render_vi`` + ``build_diff_viewer``). It sits ABOVE both — which is why it
can't live in ``graph.diff``: the engine must never import render (that would be
an import cycle). ``text``/``json`` never touch the renderer.
